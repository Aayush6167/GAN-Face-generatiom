# GAN-Face-generatiom
Welcome to the GitHub repository for GAN-Face-generation!

This repository contains code for generating human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a type of deep neural network that can learn to generate realistic images. In this project, we use a GAN to generate realistic human faces from a dataset of celebrity faces.

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have Python installed, as well as the following packages:

PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL
Once you have these packages installed, you can run the code in main.py. This script contains the main code for training the GAN and generating new faces.

The GAN is trained on a dataset of celebrity faces, which is included in the repository under the data/ directory. You can use a different dataset if you like, but you will need to modify the code accordingly.

The generated faces will be saved in the output/ directory. You can adjust the number of faces generated and other parameters by modifying the code in main.py.

This project is meant to be a simple demonstration of GANs and face generation, and there are many ways it can be improved. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different techniques to improve the quality of the generated faces.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue on the repository or contact the author directly. Thanks for checking out this project!
